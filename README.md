### Hola!

I'm Leti, a FOMO-driven developer from Uruguay, remotely working for the US 🌎  

Proud mom of 2 cats, who might secretly be plotting my downfall or just playing hard to get. 🐈

Software engineering has been my antidote to boredom — I've been hooked ever since I started. Passionate about constant improvement in every aspect: teams, processes, products, people. Having forged my path in both technical and management arenas, I'm tremendously interested in the realm of psychology, because let's face it, it's what drives it all. 💡

I teach software architecture at ORT University, and my slides are filled with self-made memes that I should probably have copyrighted. 👩🏼‍🏫

Ruby on Rails is my ultimate jam, and along with agile teams in SaaS companies, they are the bread and butter of my everyday. 💞

I love fitness, mindfulness, minimalism, interior design, and going to bed before 10pm. But honestly, I sometimes wish I was doing more to make the world a better place.
